# **Separable Decomposition for Ragged Tensors**

## **Environment Setup**

The Project was implemented in MATLAB R2023a on a Windows 10 platform. 
* Required Tensor Toolbox version: [3.1](https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/-/releases/v3.1) \[1\]
* Required Poblano_toolbox version: [1.1](https://github.com/sandialabs/poblano_toolbox)

## **Segment Completion**

* Demo 1: `demo_segment_color.m`  
  This demonstration utilizes the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) dataset. ([Official Website](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) | [Kaggle Mirror](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/banuprasadb/pascal-voc-2012)).  
  * Segments were extracted using the masks provided with the dataset.  
* Demo 2: `demo_segment_MSI.m`  
  This demonstration utilizes the CAVE public multispectral image (MSI) dataset [Link](https://cave.cs.columbia.edu/repository/Multispectral).  
  * Segments were extracted via the SLIC superpixel segmentation algorithm \[1\].

## **HSI Denoising**

* Demo 3: `demo_HSI_denosing.m` 
  This demonstration utilizes public hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets.  
  * **Pavia University:** [Link](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/e/ee/PaviaU.mat)  
  * **Washington DC Mall:** [Link](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~biehl/MultiSpec/hyperspectral.html)  
  * Segments were extracted via the SLIC superpixel segmentation algorithm \[2\].

## **ST Recovery**

* **Demo 4:** `demo_ST.m`

The public spatial transcriptomics (ST) datasets were sourced from [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets).
